# UIUC-Student-Success
The machine learning model I built as a student researcher at UIUC's Data Technology Innovation Lab. Able to predict business student grades with 90% accuracy.

I am not able to share most of the source code and certainly not any academic data I worked with. Under FERPA, we did not receive any data that we can use to personally identify students and their grades. However, we still must not share any academic data.

The source code I wrote for preprocessing data for our machine learning model, the ML app we deployed for academic advisors, the visualizations I created to analyze different student groups and my peer's interesting work on how course pairing affects GPA are ommitted due to privacy concerns.

In this repo, you may find the presentation I compiled to explain the design and thought process while creating a machine learning model to predict student grades.
